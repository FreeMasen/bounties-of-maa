A call has been sent out to the citizens of Revon to recruit brave souls to embark on an incredible adventure to far away worlds. Characters must have the Spell-casting ability to qualify, (Barbarian, Fighter, or Rogue characters must take a subclass to participate) and no Spelljamming experience is required! Volunteers will be paid 100gp after 4 weeks of participation. All participants in this study will be required to live at the research facility and all meals will be provided.<br>The very first <a data-href="Grasshopper Ship" href="bounties-of-maa/misc/grasshopper-ship.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Grasshopper Ship</a> was test piloted by <a data-href="Timmon Fizbang" href="bounties-of-maa/npcs/timmon-fizbang.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Timmon Fizbang</a> (assistant to <a data-href="Professor Tizzik" href="bounties-of-maa/npcs/professor-tizzik.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Professor Tizzik</a>). These early test flights were largely terrestrial. Using this rudimentary version, Timmon was able to successfully travel from <a data-href="Palicona" href="bounties-of-maa/locations/palicona.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Palicona</a> to <a data-href="Duultha" href="bounties-of-maa/locations/duultha.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Duultha</a> to retrieve a message for <a data-href="Professor Tizzik" href="bounties-of-maa/npcs/professor-tizzik.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Professor Tizzik</a> which took roughly a 6 hours to complete the round trip, a sea ship would have take a full day just to make one leg of this journey. After this incredibly achievement, the next test flight was to attempt to reach the moon around <a data-href="Maa" href="bounties-of-maa/locations/maa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Maa</a>. Upon exiting the atmosphere, a Squid ship attacked, since the pilot's concentration was occupied by the spelljamming helm, Timmon wasn't able to cast any spells or control the <a data-href="Auto Bolt Cannon" href="bounties-of-maa/items/auto-bolt-cannon.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Auto Bolt Cannon</a> to provide any resistance. The squid ship closed in quickly but Timmon was able to cast dimension door before the attack was able to land a final blow.<br><a data-href="Professor Tizzik" href="bounties-of-maa/npcs/professor-tizzik.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Professor Tizzik</a> now having some credible and compelling evidence that spelljamming can be made more accessible by shrinking the size of the vessels, went in search of funding to build a second generation of ships. <a data-href="Viceroy Florian Ott" href="bounties-of-maa/npcs/viceroy-florian-ott.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Viceroy Florian Ott</a> was quite impressed with the potential and offered to invest in the research. The manufacture of 5 new ships took the better part of a year, and now the professor is looking for new test pilots, Timmon is understandably rattled by their encounter with the squid ship.<br>Many folks have attended the informational sessions but so far no one has signed up after learning of the risks. The investment made by <a data-href="Viceroy Florian Ott" href="bounties-of-maa/npcs/viceroy-florian-ott.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Viceroy Florian Ott</a> was with public funds provided by the <a data-href="Council of Stewards" href="bounties-of-maa/misc/council-of-stewards.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Council of Stewards</a>'s Committee for Innovation in Magic (CIM) and the report for effectiveness of the investment is coming due, which has caused the Viceroy to put some extra pressure on the Professor to find some damn pilots. <br><a data-href="Timmon Fizbang" href="bounties-of-maa/npcs/timmon-fizbang.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Timmon Fizbang</a> has recently been able to bottle a batch of a tonic that operates similar to the spell <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618956-revivify" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618956-revivify" target="_self">Revivify</a> but to avoid the expense of a 300gp diamond, they used a much less rare gem and as a result the revivified person is always reset back to level 1.
