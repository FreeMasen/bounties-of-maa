Each time a bolt has been fired, the Aim action must be taken before it can be fired again. Aiming and firing required pulling a series of leavers in the correct order. If a player has a Wisdom, Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence of less than 10, the character must roll a DC 10 ability check (the player can choose any of the above 4 abilities) with proficiency.

The cheapening of the spell has some unfortunate consequences, primarily that any character revived with this tonic will be reset to level 1 (though they would still be bound to any sub-class they had previously taken however the sub-class can only allow for early acquisition of the Spellcasting feat but not any spells or other benefits from the sub-class). The base spell Revivify doesn't perform any healing other than restoring life to the dead, any wounds will scar badly, missing limbs are not restored, etc, this remains true for the tonic but as with anything fast and cheap this potion isn't as good as it seems, at least one additional personality flaw should be applied to your character. The next section outlines some examples of how these flaws might impact a given character.These flaws are provided as an example but don't feel bound to just the options listed below, work with your DM to explore any alternatives or modifications to help bring your character to life.Roll a D20 and use the following table to apply a flaw to your character.Most of the memories of your former life are gone, however there are flashes of your true past that haunt you regularly. While these are true memories, they feel foreign somehow. This effect will typically begin with the memory of your own death but little is available other than that one memory. Slowly and erratically, your brain is attempting to stitch you past together which results in surreal recalling of a memory on a regular cadence. At the start of each day, you roll a d20 and if you get less than 10 in a consecutive number of days, a recall episode will occur that day. Work with your DM to find a right number of days but a potential starting point is 3 in a row. The DM will then decide when this recollection will occur, it may be accompanied with other conditions and happen at an inconvenient time, say in the middle of battle.<br>A character may choose to delve into these memories, taking 4 hour period to do so, during this time they may not receive the benefits of a short or long rest and must succeed a DC 15 Constitution saving throw otherwise you acquire a level of Exhaustion that can only be removed by a <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618961-greater-restoration\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618961-greater-restoration\" target=\"_self\">Greater Restoration</a> spell or a <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5360-potion-of-vitality\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5360-potion-of-vitality\" target=\"_self\">Potion of Vitality</a>.The process of interrupting your death has actually stollen someone else's memories. These haunting visions are from the perspective of someone who most likely doesn't even live on the same planet or even in the wildspace system as you. Very much of the context is missing from these memories so, recalling them is often a very difficult experience. While they may provide some utility, they are so disorienting that actively attempting to retrieve anything useful from them would feel similar to stealing an egg from an owlbear; it may provide the sustenance you need but the risk... wouldn't those berries be a better way to feed yourself?At the start of each day, you roll a d20 and if you get less than 10 in a consecutive number of days, a recall episode will occur that day. Work with your DM to find a right number of days but a potential starting point is 3 in a row.

For example a Gnome, wouldn't be able to speak or learn Gnomish, doesn't receive the benefits of Gnomish Cunning or Darkvision and cannot choose a Gnomish Lineage. Work with your DM if the loss of this part of your origin is too drastic, they may allow you to take an additional background or grant you other benefits if it helps make your character more interesting.You are plagued by intrusive thoughts and impulses that run directly counter to your alignment. Each day, roll a d20, on a roll below 11, you will experience an episode of dissonant alignment, the lower the roll the more severe.<br>The following table provides examples for how these episodes may be organized, they all refer\nto the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/creating-a-character#PersonalityTraitsbyAlignment\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/creating-a-character#PersonalityTraitsbyAlignment\" target=\"_self\">Personality Traits by Alignment</a> from the Player Handbook.Work with your DM to tweak the cadence and impact of this flaw.

A call has been sent out to the citizens of Revon to recruit brave souls to embark on an incredible adventure to far away worlds. Characters must have the Spellcasting ability to qualify, (Barbarian, Fighter, Monk, or Rogue characters must take a subclass to participate [see <a data-href=\"#Player Hooks\" href=\"bounties-of-maa/01.-setup.html#Player_Hooks_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Player Hooks</a> for options]) and no Spelljamming experience is required! Volunteers will be paid 100gp after an expected 4 weeks of the experiment. All participants in this study will be required to live at the research facility and all meals will be provided.<br>The very first <a data-href=\"Grasshopper Ship\" href=\"bounties-of-maa/items/grasshopper-ship.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Grasshopper Ship</a> was test piloted by <a data-href=\"Timmon Fizbang\" href=\"bounties-of-maa/npcs/timmon-fizbang.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Timmon Fizbang</a> (assistant to <a data-href=\"Professor Tizzik\" href=\"bounties-of-maa/npcs/professor-tizzik.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Professor Tizzik</a>). These early test flights were largely terrestrial. Using this rudimentary version, Timmon was able to successfully travel from <a data-href=\"Palicona\" href=\"bounties-of-maa/locations/palicona.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Palicona</a> to <a data-href=\"Duultha\" href=\"bounties-of-maa/locations/duultha.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Duultha</a> to retrieve a message for <a data-href=\"Professor Tizzik\" href=\"bounties-of-maa/npcs/professor-tizzik.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Professor Tizzik</a> which took roughly a 6 hours to complete the round trip, a sea ship would have take a full day just to make one leg of this journey. After this incredibly achievement, the next test flight was to attempt to reach the moon around <a data-href=\"Maa\" href=\"bounties-of-maa/locations/maa.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Maa</a>. Upon exiting the atmosphere, a Squid ship attacked, since the pilot's concentration was occupied by the spelljamming helm, Timmon wasn't able to cast any spells or control the <a data-href=\"Auto Bolt Cannon\" href=\"bounties-of-maa/items/auto-bolt-cannon.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Auto Bolt Cannon</a> to provide any resistance. The squid ship closed in quickly but Timmon was able to cast dimension door before the attack was able to land a final blow.<br><a data-href=\"Professor Tizzik\" href=\"bounties-of-maa/npcs/professor-tizzik.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Professor Tizzik</a> now having some credible and compelling evidence that spelljamming can be made more accessible by shrinking the size of the vessels, went in search of funding to build a second generation of ships. <a data-href=\"Viceroy Florian Ott\" href=\"bounties-of-maa/npcs/viceroy-florian-ott.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Viceroy Florian Ott</a> was quite impressed with the potential and offered to invest in the research. The manufacture of 5 new ships took the better part of a year, and now the professor is looking for new test pilots, Timmon is understandably rattled by their encounter with the squid ship.<br>Many folks have attended the informational sessions but so far no one has signed up after learning of the risks. The investment made by <a data-href=\"Viceroy Florian Ott\" href=\"bounties-of-maa/npcs/viceroy-florian-ott.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Viceroy Florian Ott</a> was with public funds provided by the <a data-href=\"Council of Stewards\" href=\"bounties-of-maa/societies/council-of-stewards.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Council of Stewards</a>'s Committee for Innovation in Magic (CIM) and the report for effectiveness of the investment is coming due, which has caused the Viceroy to put some extra pressure on the Professor to find some damn pilots. <br>To address the need for the pilot to be concentrating on steering the spelljamming helm, <a data-href=\"Professor Tizzik\" href=\"bounties-of-maa/npcs/professor-tizzik.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Professor Tizzik</a> has purchased the materials required to create a handful of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Circlet of Concentration\" data-href=\"Circlet of Concentration\" href=\"bounties-of-maa/items/circlet-of-concentration.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Circlets of Concentration</a> to attach to the helm of each <a data-href=\"Grasshopper Ship\" href=\"bounties-of-maa/items/grasshopper-ship.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Grasshopper Ship</a>. Unfortunately, the materials were stolen in transit. Your first mission will be to recover these materials, however we need some training first.<br>This campaign is designed to start with characters at level 1, which can make playing non-spellcasting classes difficult as most sub-classes don't arrive until level 3.

No one knows if this could cause a cataclysmic event or the scale of that event.\nThe idea to use permanent or semi-permanent magical effects to travel is a new concept and has caused a fair amount of death and destruction in the last few years.
